```
This script can check your changelogs and bump versions in project.
It's rigorous. Check will fail if any commit or pull request from git history is missed.
It assumes to be run in root directory of project and that changelog is here.
Project must be git repository.
You can specify these levels of changes: app, major, minor, fix, doc.
It can infer version from changelog.
But it will refuse to do it if it's not sure changelogs are up to date.

                        [-c|--no-check] [-e|--from-bc]

Available options:

  -p,--packages PACKAGES   List of packages to bump.
  -l,--level LEVEL         Level of changes
  -c,--no-check            Do not check changelogs.
